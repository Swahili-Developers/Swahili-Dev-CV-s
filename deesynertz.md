## About me

> <p align="justify"> A self-motivated person, who has a big passion for web technologies. I have a big curiosity to understand how computers working and what they can do for us. As the cognitive path about computers was related to remote technologies., so I am focused on programming languages and IT systems which helps to communicate and complete tasks from a distance. My main back-end scripting language is PHP, Javascript (Node JS) and for the front-end currently, I am using Angular (Javascript Framework) and Laravel (PHP framework). I am able to design systems by finding all functional and non-functional requirements, and providing the best solution to minimize the cost.</p>
